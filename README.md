CypherSlot
===========

CypherSlot is a provably fair, decentralized, cryptographic slot game. 
The initial implementation is a 3-reel slot named "Golden Faucet" in which real winnings are made possible, without any investment by either players or hosts, through cryptocurrency faucets (standard game funding/reward models and smart contract verification are also possible).
The game is played through a downloadable desktop client (Adobe AIR), and hosted on any computer capable of running Node.js + MongoDB (a "hostless" smart contract mode is also possible).
Both players and hosts communicate through Tor to ensure privacy and anonymity.
