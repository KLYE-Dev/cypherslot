	<p class="normal"><i>Golden Faucet</i> is a radically different type of slot game in which <b>you</b> pick the results and where you can win <b>real</b> cryptocurrency <b>for free!</b></p>
	<p class="normal">Unlike traditional slot games, credits for <i>Golden Faucet</i> are earned by interacting with cryptocurrency faucets (hence the name).</p>
	<p class="normal">You can quickly earn enough credits to play for a chance to win <i>real</i> cryptocurrency. When you run out of credits simply replenish them - you never need to wait for a faucet's time limit to elapse and your account is credited instantly!</p>
	<p class="normal">Winning prizes are sent to the payout address you specify <i>immediately</i> - no need to wait for some minimum value or time limit to elapse.</p>
	<p class="normal">Even better, each spin can earn you <i>shares</i> in the game. Once you've achieved the status of <b>shareholder</b> you become eligible to receive a percentage of the game's profits, paid out at regular intervals. Even when you don't win, you win!</p>
